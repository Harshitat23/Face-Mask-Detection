# Face-Mask-Detection

This project uses deep learning and computer vision techniques to detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not using images or real-time video streams. The application leverages a pre-trained model to detect faces and predict whether a mask is being worn.

## 🔍 Features

- Real-time face mask detection using webcam or video feed
- Detects faces and predicts whether the person is wearing a mask or not
- Built using Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV
- Simple and easy-to-use web interface for testing

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) – for machine learning model
- [Keras](https://keras.io/) – high-level neural networks API used with TensorFlow
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) – for image processing and real-time video handling

## Output
Real-time Webcam Feed: The inetrface will display a live video feed with bounding boxes drawn around detected faces. It will label them as either "Mask" or "No Mask."

## 📌 How It Works
- The application uses OpenCV to capture the webcam video or load images/videos.
- The result (mask or no mask) is displayed on the video feed or image with a bounding box.
